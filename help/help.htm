<h1>Monorder_XH - a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../monorder.png" alt="Order form"
     style="width: 128px; height: 128px; float: left">
<p>Monorder_XH facilitates placing order or reservation forms for single items
resp. events (hence the name which is a synaeresis of "mono" and "order") on
your website. Ordering resp. booking takes in account the number of items on
stock resp. the free places, so overbooking is not possible.</p>
<p>The forms have to be created with <a
href="http://3-magi.net/?CMSimple_XH/Advancedform_XH">Advancedform_XH</a>, and
it is possible to use a single form for multiple sales items resp. events.
However, it is only possible to offer one form for a particular item resp. event
on each page, so if you have more demanding needs use a shopping resp. a
booking system.</p>
<p>Besides its actual use, Monorder_XH serves to demonstrate the possibilities
and limitations of using Advancedform_XH's hook system for custom plugins.</p>

<p><strong>Please do read this documentation, <em>before</em> you encounter any
problems!</strong></p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Monorder_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH &ge; 1.5.4,
PHP &ge; 5.1 and Advancedform_XH.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory monorder/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
plugins/ directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories css/, config/, languages/ and
the plugin's data folder.</li>
<li>Protect Monorder_XH's data folder against direct access by any means your
webserver provides. .htaccess files for Apache servers are already placed
in the default data folder.</li>
<li>Browse to Monorder_XH's administration to check if all requirements are
fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select Plugins &rarr; Monorder.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Monorder_XH under "Config". Hints
for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of the Monorder_XH can be customized under "Stylesheet".</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>As already mentioned in the introduction Monorder_XH can be used for order
forms as well as reservation forms&mdash;with regard to the plugin these
concepts are identical, so in the following the term <em>orders</em> refers to
reservations as well, the term <em>item</em> refers to order or sales items as
well as events, and the term <em>amount</em> refers to the order amount as well
as the attendance of an event. For reservation purposes you should change the
respective terms in the language settings of the plugin.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-formprep">Form preparation</h3>
<p>At first you have to prepare the order form in the <a
href="http://3-magi.net/plugins/advancedform/help/help.htm#usage-administration">mail
form administration</a> of Advancedform_XH. The characteristic of forms usable
with Monorder_XH is that they <em>must</em> contain a numeric or hidden field
with the name "order_amount", and that they <em>can</em> contain a text or
hidden field with the name "order_item" (both names can be changed in the
configuration of the plugin, but must be the same for all forms).</p>
<p>Note, that hidden fields will not be contained in the confirmation mail, and
that a confirmation will only be sent, if there is a thanks page defined for the
form and it contains a field of type "Sender (e-mail)".</p>
<p>Further note, that while you can use Advancedform_XH's <a
href="http://3-magi.net/plugins/advancedform/help/help.htm#usage-templates">template
system</a> for Monorder_XH forms, you cannot use the <a
href="http://3-magi.net/plugins/advancedform/help/help.htm#usage-hooks">hook
system</a>, as this is already used by Monorder_XH behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If you want to keep a better overview of all orders, you can activate the
"store data" option of the form. Note, that all orders made via this form will
be stored in the same CSV file independent of the item. To sort that out you can
temporarily import the CSV file to a spreadsheet software and use its
capabilities.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-itemprep">Item preparation</h3>
<p>For each item you want to offer you have to create a new record in the
administration of Monorder_XH and you have to specify its available amount. Of
course, you can adjust this amount anytime as appropriate. The name of the item
is only for internal use, unless you have placed an order_item field on your
form, in which case its value will be the name of the item. So it is sensible to
use a speaking name, such as "Yellow CMSimple_XH T-shirt XL" or "CMSimple_XH
seminar, 2014-03-21".</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-display">Displaying the form</h3>
<p>To display an order form on a page use the following plugin call:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:Monorder_form('FORM_NAME', 'ITEM_NAME');}}}</pre>
<p>where FORM_NAME is the name of the Advancedform_XH form, and ITEM_NAME is the
name of the Monorder_XH item, e.g.:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:Monorder_form('order', 'Yellow CMSimple_XH T-shirt XL');}}}</pre>
<p>If there are items on stock the number is displayed above the form; otherwise
there will be a message that there are no items available, and the form is not
displayed at all.</p>
<p>When a customer submits the form, the form validation will make sure that the
number of order_amount items is on stock, and that the value of order_item has
not been changed to something else; otherwise the email will not be sent. If
everything is okay the email will be sent and the order_amount is subtracted
from the stock.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h3 id="usage-inventory">Inventory</h3>
<p>If you like you can display the number of available items on other pages (for
instance, on an overview page). Therefore use the following plugin call:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:Monorder_inventory('ITEM_NAME');}}}</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:Monorder_inventory('Yellow CMSimple_XH T-shirt XL');}}}</pre>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
